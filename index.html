            <h3> About </h3>
            <p> Iâ€™m a Game and Interaction Designer, with additional interests in user experience design and education. My objective is to create engaging and inspiring user experiences. My ideal role would allow me to use my creativity, analytical and practical problem solving skills. <br/> <br/>
                
                I have been teaching at several universities in Australia and Canada while completing my studies. While teaching began as a part time job, it soon became my passion and personal interest and I have since completed over 1000 hours of classroom time. <br/> <br/>
                
                Living, studying and working in India, Australia and Canada has allowed me to experience different pedagogical methods in various fields of digital media and I aim to share this amalgamation of diverse experiences with my students.
